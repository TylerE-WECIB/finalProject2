This website (cipher.html) is a caesar cypher. It encodes/decodes messages by shifting all of the letter values by a value.
Enter your message in the input box, choose your settings using the options below (encrypt/decrypt, shift direction, shift index), and click submit
an output will appear in the output box

Encrypt/Decrypt = treats the shift index as the opposite positive/negative value of the shift direction. use to encrypt a code, and change to decrypt to decrypt the message with the same settings.
Shift Direction = Right/Left. treats the shift index as negative if left and positive if right (or the alphabet as Z-A vs A-Z)
Shift Index = the number of letters the code will change by: If Shift Direction = Right and Shift Index = 2, then A -> C
